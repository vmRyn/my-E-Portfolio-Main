            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p class="data">My name is Ryan Dempsey, I am 18 years old and was born on the 18th of June, ever since i have touched a console or something i can play games on i have been very attached to it and still to this day i am attached to games, when i got older i started to understand how games were made and i looked into it and found the world of coding which opened many more interests to me, In secondary school i chose ICT then in College i continued my interest of coding into Software & Web Development and I am still doing it to this day, in the future have a job in some sort of app development or web development as you learn something new every second within the world of coding.</p>
